        <div class="place1">
            <div class="vanvihar">
                <p>Van Vihar National Park and Zoo is one of the most revered National Park and Zoo of Central India
                    and
                    is a shining beacon in the field of conservation. It is an amazing world of winged creatures,
                    free
                    ranging ungulates and captive carnivores in the midst of greenery.

                    The park which is more popularly known as just “Van Vihar” is considered as a “must see”
                    destination
                    for tourists visiting Bhopal. The characteristic combination of rich wetland areas, meadows,
                    pools
                    of water at different places, rugged slopes, mixed bamboo vegetation along with grass covered
                    plateau and areas of mixed plantations support the rich floral and faunal diversity in the area.

                    This green oasis amidst the city of lakes also plays a very vital role as a carbon sink
                    contributing
                    to environmental health of Bhopal. It is situated right next to the famous Upper Lake of Bhopal
                    also
                    known as the “Bada Talab” which is a Ramsar Site and one of the two lakes of Bhoj Wetland.</p>

        <div class="place2">
            <div class="bhimbetka">
                <p>The Bhimbetka rock shelters are an archaeological site in central India that spans the Paleolithic
                    and Mesolithic periods, as well as the historic period.[1][2] It exhibits the earliest traces of
                    human life in India and evidence of the Stone Age starting at the site in Acheulian times.[3][4][5]
                    It is located in the Raisen District in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, about 45 kilometres (28
                    mi) south-east of Bhopal. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that consists of seven hills and over
                    750 rock shelters distributed over 10 km (6.2 mi).[2][6] At least some of the shelters were
                    inhabited more than 100,000 years ago.[2][7] The rock shelters and caves provide evidence of human
                    settlement and the cultural evolution from hunter-gatherers to agriculture, and expressions of
                    prehistoric spirituality.[8]

                    Some of the Bhimbetka rock shelters feature prehistoric cave paintings and the earliest are dated to
                    10,000 BCE, corresponding to the Indian Mesolithic.[9][10][11][12][13][14] These cave paintings show
                    themes such as animals, early evidence of dance and hunting from the Stone Age as well as of
                    warriors on horseback from a later time (perhaps the Bronze Age).[15][16][17] The Bhimbetka site has
                    the oldest-known rock art in India,[18] as well as is one of the largest prehistoric complexes.</p>

                <p>Bhojtal, formerly known as Upper Lake,[1] is a large lake which lies on the western side of the
                    capital city of Madhya Pradesh, Bhopal, India. It is a major source of drinking water for the
                    residents of the city, serving around 40% of the residents with nearly 30 million imperial gallons
                    (140,000 m3) of water per day.[2] Bada talaab, along with the nearby Chhota Talaab, meaning small
                    lake in Hindi, constitute Bhoj Wetland, which is now a Ramsar site.[3]</p>

                <p>Shaurya Smarak (Sanskrit : शौर्य स्मारक) is a war memorial situated at Bhopal, inaugurated by the
                    Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi on 14 October 2016.[1] Shaurya Smarak is established by the
                    government of Madhya Pradesh[2] at Bhopal in the heart area of Arera Hills near M.P. Nagar and
                    Secretariat. It is sprawled over a large area of about 12 acres. It is developed as a public park
                    with imaginative and interesting architectural installations depicting the sacrifice of the
                    soldiers. In the park, there is a 62-feet high sculpture rising from the ground called Shaurya
                    Stambh depicting the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force. The Army is signified by Granite, The Navy in
                    Grey, and the Air Force in White. Around the Shaurya Stambh names of the martyred soldiers have been
                    inscribed on glass boards. Beside the Shaurya Stambh, there is Smarak Jyoti which is lit in
                    holographic flame for the honor of the martyrs. Not only this there is a red sculpture kept in the
                    park which when seen from the main axis it appears as a 'Namaskar' and when looked at from another
                    axis it appears as 'A Drop of Blood'.It is the first war memorial[3] of the country built in the
                    memory of martyrs.</p>

            <div class="tribal">
                <p>The Madhya Pradesh Tribal Museum in Bhopal takes you on an immersive journey through the culture of
                    the local tribes of the state. With large colourful displays, the museum shows the art, traditions,
                    daily life, and customs of a large number of indigenous groups.The Tribal Life Gallery has
                    full-sized models of the tribes’ houses and dwellings, large enough for visitors to go inside.
                    In another gallery, stories of worship and sacrifice are portrayed through impressive art
                    installations. Artefacts from daily life are presented alongside cultural symbols that contain deep
                    meanings passed through the generations.
                    The museum has a particular focus on tribal art and how it relates to the culture. A musical
                    instrument, for example, is also a part of an important ritual. A sculpture is also a tribute to a
                    god or spiritual energy. For the tribes, everything is related to an invisible power and items are
                    both practical and supernatural at the same time.</p>

            <div class="saisapata">
                <p>Sair Sapata is a significant entertainment zone, inaugurated on 29 September 2011. The tourism
                    complex is predominantly a play park which is also a good leisure space for adults. Covering an area
                    of 24.56 acres, Sair Sapata offers enjoyable activities like forest hiking, car dashing, zorbing and
                    so on. Boat rides, four kiosks and three viewpoints keep tourists engaged.

                    The complex has attractions that actively encourage tourism, like two acres of children's play area,
                    musical fountain, toy train and a suspension bridge. Situated on the banks of the Bada Talaab (Upper
                    Lake) of Bhopal, the suspension bridge is a significant attraction. Built with RCC deck slabs along
                    the lines of Lachman Jhula, it is believed to be the first pedestrian bridge made this way in India.
                    With a motive to extend tourist facilities, Madhya Pradesh State Tourism Development Corporation
                    renovated and developed Sair Sapata.</p>
